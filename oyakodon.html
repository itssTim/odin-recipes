        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oyakodon is a comforting Japanese rice bowl dish featuring tender chicken, onions, and eggs simmered in a savory-sweet broth made from soy sauce, mirin, and dashi. The ingredients are cooked together until the chicken is juicy and the eggs are slightly soft and velvety, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures. "Oyakodon" translates to "parent-and-child bowl," referencing the use of both chicken (the "parent") and eggs (the "child"). Served over a steaming bowl of white rice, it’s a simple yet satisfying meal, beloved for its warmth and homey feel.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1  tablespoon sake</li>
            <li>3-4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dash</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 servings cooked rice</li>
            <li>4 sprigs green onion or scallion</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Seasoning Preparation</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl mix 1/2 cup dashi, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons mirin, and 2 teaspoon sugar. Stirring until dissolved</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Ingredient prep</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice 1/2 onion</li>
            <li>Chop 4 sprigs green onion or scallion</li>
            <li>Trim fat and connective tissue from 10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Slice chicken along the grain into 1 inch strips, then cut diagonally against the grain into 1 inch pieces (sogigiri style) for even cooking</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a bowl, sprinkle with 1 Tbsp sake, and let sit for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Crack 3–4 large eggs into a bowl. Use chopsticks to cut through the whites 5–6 times—don’t fully mix. Maintain a marbled look with distinct white and yellow parts.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cooking Oyakodon</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>With the heat off, layer onions in a medium pan. Pour in the seasoning—just enough to cover the onions</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add chicken on top</li>
            <li>Distribute evenly. Once simmering again, reduce heat to medium low. Cook uncovered for 5 minutes, flipping chicken halfway</li>
            <li>Turn heat to medium. Once bubbling, drizzle in 2/3 of the eggs in a circular motion, avoiding pan edges. Add more whites at this stage</li>
            <li>If egg moves to the pan edges, gently move it back to the center. Cover if needed to help the whites set</li>
            <li>When eggs are mostly set but still runny, add the remaining one-third. Top with green onion or scallion and cook to desired doneness</li>
            <li>Serve over steamed rice, spooning chicken and egg mixture on top with some sauce</li>
        </ol>
