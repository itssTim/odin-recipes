        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kimbap is a popular Korean dish made of steamed rice and assorted fillings such as vegetables, eggs, pickled radish, and meat or seafood, all rolled in sheets of seaweed (gim) and sliced into bite-sized pieces. Often compared to sushi rolls, kimbap is distinct in its use of sesame oil–flavored rice instead of vinegar and typically includes cooked rather than raw ingredients. It’s a convenient, colorful, and nutritious meal commonly enjoyed as a picnic food, lunchbox staple, or street snack in Korea.</p>
